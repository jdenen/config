* git

  Because much of my work is on macOS, I must ignore =.DS_Store= files
  everywhere. And because I use LSP with Emacs, a =.elixir_ls/= directory
  is added to all of my projects. To make life easy, this is written to
  =~/.gitignore=:

  #+BEGIN_SRC conf :tangle ~/.gitignore
    .DS_Store
    .elixir_ls/
  #+END_SRC

  Most of my Git configuration is self-explanatory. I prefer =--graph=
  on all diffs, as I think it's easier to read. I want to add =--prune=
  to =git fetch= and =--rebase= to =git pull= by default.

  And I turn on rerere:

  #+BEGIN_SRC conf :tangle ~/.gitconfig
    [user]
    name = Johnson Denen
    email = johnson.denen@gmail.com

    [alias]
    log = log --graph

    [color]
    ui = true

    [diff]
    renames = true

    [fetch]
    prune = true

    [pull]
    rebase = true

    [push]
    default = simple
    ff = false

    [rerere]
    enabled = true

    [core]
    excludesfile = ~/.gitignore
  #+END_SRC
