This is my setup for Elixir development. I use =asdf= to manage Erlang/Elixir
versions, =git= for version control, and Emacs for just about everything else.

Each piece is configured in its own =.org= file. Each =.org= file is a literate
config file and can be executed with =(org-babel-tangle)= in Emacs.
