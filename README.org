My dotfiles for working with Elixir

* Usage

  This repo is a collection of [[https://thewanderingcoder.com/2015/02/literate-emacs-configuration/][literate]] configuration files.

  Open each =.org= file in Emacs and use ~M-x org-babel-tangle~ to provision
  your machine with its configuration.

  *WARNING*: ~M-x org-babel-tangle~ will overwrite any existing configuration
  files already present on your machine. In the case of =bash.org=, this would
  rewrite your =~/.bash_profile= and =~/.bashrc= files.

* Install

  Link [[file:.spacemacs][.spacemacs]] to your =$HOME= directory to include any future changes
  automatically.

  #+BEGIN_SRC sh :export none
    ln -s "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/.spacemacs" ~/.spacemacs
  #+END_SRC

  Some of the =.org= files include =Installation= sections. These manual, one-time
  steps are suggested to ensure everything just works (TM).
