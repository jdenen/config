* config

  My dotfiles for working with Elixir

** Usage
Run =git clone git@github.com:jdenen/config $HOME/.doom.d= and install [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs][doom]].

There are also [[file:config/][some]] [[https://thewanderingcoder.com/2015/02/literate-emacs-configuration/][literate]] configuration files to setup a machine outside of Emacs. Open
each =config/*.org= file and run =org-babel-tangle=.

*WARNING*: =org-babel-tangle= will overwrite any existing configuration files already present on your
machine. If you were to execute =config/bash.org=, for example, you would rewrite your
=~/.bash_profile= and =~/.bashrc= files.
