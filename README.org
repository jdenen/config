#+TITLE: Emacs <> Elixir
#+STARTUP: inlineimages nofold

Configuration for my MacOS development environment:
+ [[https://ohmyz.sh][Oh My Zsh]]
+ Git with GPG signing
+ [[https://elixir-lang.org][Elixir]], Erlang, NodeJS managed by =asdf=
+ [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs][Doom]] Emacs using [[https://github.com/elixir-lsp/elixir-ls][ElixirLS]]

To use:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :export none :eval query :results silent
/usr/bin/env bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jdenen/config/master/setup.sh)"
#+END_SRC

The script will clone this repo to =~/Code=, installing and configuring all kinds of stuff for local development.
Unless you're me, I wouldn't suggest running this script blindly. Better to take a look at the script and copy/paste
what commands you want to run, I think.
